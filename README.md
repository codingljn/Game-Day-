# Game-Day-

<p> Planning a stress free day out at the ballpark can sometimes be challenging. What’s the weather going to be like? You won't find out here...we didn't use that API. What should I eat before I go? Are there good parking spots near the stadium? Let US help YOU plan your day efficiently so you can spend more time enjoying the things that matter the most….watching your favorite baseball team on a nice summer evening.</p>
